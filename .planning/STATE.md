# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** An administrator can connect two Wanderer instances so that public content flows between them automatically, using the same ActivityPub machinery already powering user-level federation.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Instance Actor

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Instance Actor)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-22 — Roadmap created; ready for Phase 1 planning

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Extend existing ActivityPub actor model; no new dependencies needed
- PocketBase admin UI only for v1 (no web/mobile admin)
- Mutual approval for instance follows (not auto-accept)
- No historical backfill on new connection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SAFE-01 (broadcast loop deduplication) MUST ship in the same phase as SYNC-01/02/03 — fanout without dedup creates broadcast storms
- `initInstanceActor()` must guard keypair regeneration — if actor exists, never overwrite the key
- `Reject{Follow}` is mandatory (not optional) — remote gets stuck permanently without it

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
